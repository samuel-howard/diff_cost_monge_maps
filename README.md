# Differentiable Cost-Parameterized Monge Map Estimators

Research code for the [Differentiable Almost Everything, ICML 2024](https://differentiable.xyz/) workshop paper [Differentiable Cost-Parameterized Monge Map Estimators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08399). 

Normalizing flows implementation uses the [jax-flows](https://github.com/ChrisWaites/jax-flows) repository by [Chris Waites](https://github.com/ChrisWaites); toy dataset and experiment from [Somnath et al. 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11419); uses code based on [OTT-JAX](https://github.com/ott-jax/ott) library.
